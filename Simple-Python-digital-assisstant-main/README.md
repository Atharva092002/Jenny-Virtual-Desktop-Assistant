# Simple-Python-digital-assisstant
This is a simple Python code for a voice enabled digital assisstant. Currently, the assisstant is named Jenny.
Based on Python, it uses the default female voice available in Microsoft Windows to speak. It uses the default microphone to take voice inputs from the user and process the input to match with a predefined set of commands. Many libraries have been used like pyttsx3, pyaudio, speech_recognition, pywhatkit etc.
This was an assignment project given to a group that I was a part of in college. We developed the code for the assisstant.
