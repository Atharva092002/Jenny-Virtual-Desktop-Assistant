# Scope of innovation
After studying all the surveys, we realize that there is a lot of scope for innovation in this field. We did a comparative study between some of the existing products 
in market and realized some of the features which were common to all the products and some which were special to specific products only.
It helped us to get a clear picture on what functionalities we could incorporate in Jenny so that we could provide a more wholesome package to the user. 
Our assistant is not an entirely new technology which we are developing. The aim of our project is to build an assistant with features which are essential 
and at the same time unique. Some of the unique features which Jenny offers are telling CPU stats, WhatsApp messaging, carry out commands related to PDF’s.....
